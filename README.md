üõ°Ô∏è Welcome to Coinback RPC
Coinback RPC is a specialized network for your Ethereum wallet that gives you two major superpowers: transaction security and cashback rewards.

Every time you use a decentralized application (dApp) on Ethereum‚Äîwhether you're swapping tokens, buying an NFT, or interacting with a DeFi protocol‚Äîyour transaction is at risk. It enters a public "waiting room" (the mempool) where malicious bots can see it and attack it, costing you money through practices like front-running and "sandwich attacks."

Coinback RPC was built to solve this. We provide a private, secure route for your transactions that shields them from these bots while also earning you cashback in ETH on the transaction fees you pay.

‚ú® How It Works: A Simple, Secure Path
Using Coinback is designed to be effortless.

Add Our Network: With a single click on our website, you can add the Coinback RPC network to your MetaMask or other Web3 wallet.

Transact Normally: Switch to the Coinback network in your wallet and use any dApp on Ethereum just as you normally would. There are no other changes to your workflow.

We Protect & Reward: Behind the scenes, we take your transaction and send it through a private, armored channel directly to the block builders (in collaboration with Flashbots). This keeps it invisible to attacking bots. Because this method creates value, we get a share of the profit, which we then pass back to you as an ETH reward.

Claim Your ETH: Visit your dashboard on our website at any time to see your accumulated rewards and claim them directly to your wallet.

üöÄ Key Features
Front-Running & Sandwich Attack Protection: Your transactions are sent privately, keeping them safe from the most common forms of MEV attacks.

Earn ETH Cashback: Get a portion of your transaction fees back in ETH. The more you transact, the more you earn.

Complete Transparency: Your personal dashboard provides a full overview of your transaction history and the rewards you've accumulated over time.

Universal Compatibility: Works with your existing wallet and all your favorite decentralized applications. If it's on Ethereum, you can use Coinback to protect it.

Effortless Setup: Get started in seconds by adding our RPC endpoint to your wallet directly from our website.
